#Movie Gross predictor:

We are building an application in python which will predict gross of a movie based on data from movie database. 


Right now, We are in skeleton steps. 


we need to discuss the following:
- What is our goal. What are we going to model
- What are the features that can be used
- Develop various visualizations to help indicate feature selection
- Finally what machine learning model can we use
- How are we going to present the results in the documentation


The project will have the following modules:
- Preprocessor
- Model
- Visualization
- Validation

## Preprocessor 

- Drop row which has "NA"
- Drop column which maximum values are "0". Set maximum values percentage like >= 50 percentage.

## Model
## Visualization
1. Top and bottom popular movie (by imdb score) grouped by country.
2. Find the 10 most liked directors, actors.
3. Most profitable movies grouped by countries. 
4. Duration and movies grouped by year/country.
