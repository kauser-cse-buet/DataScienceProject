#Movie Gross predictor:

We are building an application in python which will predict gross of a movie based on data from movie database. 


Right now, We are in skeleton steps. 


we need to discuss the following:
- What is our goal. What are we going to model
- What are the features that can be used
- Develop various visualizations to help indicate feature selection
- Finally what machine learning model can we use
- How are we going to present the results in the documentation


The project will have the following modules:
- Preprocessor
- Model
- Visualization
- Validation

## Preprocessor 

- Drop row which has "NA"
- Drop column which maximum values are "0". Set maximum values percentage like >= 50 percentage.

## Model
## Visualization
## Validation
